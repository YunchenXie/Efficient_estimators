Code organization and execution 
00. funcs.py
    Defines some functions that can be called by other programs.

01. get_supporting_arrays.py
    Generates the spherical harmonic function arrays required in k-space and x-space,
    The results are stored by default in the Y_lm_arrays folder in the program’s directory. 
    (If you only need to measure monopole, you don’t need to run this program. 
    Make sure you have enough hard disk storage space.)

02. Full_VT.py
    Generates VT for all possible configurations and exports VT_FFT.txt, 
    which is stored by default in the program’s directory

03. mass_interpolation.py
    Assigns various weights to the mesh, outputs FKP_field and N_field, and various metadata, 
    which are stored in the specified folder. Please note that if you are measuring multiple 
    realizations in batches, you should leave enough hard disk space. 
    Based on mpi4py for multi-process acceleration. 
    Be sure to set the number of processes to 2, 5, 7, or other prime numbers.

04. B_mono_full.py
    Reads FKP_field and N_field generated by mass_interpolation.py, various metadata, 
    and VT_FFT.txt, calculates B_monopole, and outputs the results to the Results folder.
